# Tested with RB [_1000_] (http://ci.bukkit.org/job/dev-CraftBukkit/1000/)
## Dependencies:
-   Permissions 3
-   BukkitContrib (will be downloaded automatically)

## Permission nodes:
-   swordsgame.define - Define and remove arenas
-   swordsgame.play - Play (or create a game when there is no available) and list games/arenas.

## Todo:
-   Boot people from games when they use fly- or speedhacks.
-   Add configs for various things

## Notes:
-   I would GREATLY appreciate it if people could help me fix the English localisation.
-   The client side BukkitContrib mod is not required, but it will make the experience better, using sounds, notes and several other things.
-   There's currently a limit of four people per game, but this will be customizable in the future.
